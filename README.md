# GraphApplication
# Introduction:
This Java console application provides a basic implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix.  It allows users to create a graph by adding vertices and edges.
 
# What It Can Do:
The application performs the following functions:
1. Adds Vertices: Allows the user to specify the number of vertices in the graph.
2. Adds Edges:  Lets the user define edges between vertices.  The application assumes an undirected graph (an edge from A to B implies an edge from B to A).
3. Prints Graph: Displays the adjacency matrix representing the graph's structure.

# Why I made This Application:
I created this application primarily for educational purposes.  Graph data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science, and this program provides a hands-on, easily understandable example of how to implement and use one.
